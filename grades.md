# Grades and policies

##  Grade distribution

* assignments (5-6): 30%
* midterm exam: 30%
* final exam: 40%

## Collaboration

Most homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your own assignments. If you have collaborated or consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are unsure about any of these rules, consult with one of the teaching staff or visit the departmental webpage on [Collaboration and Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).


## Policies

* No makeup exam for the midterm or final. If you missed the midterm exam you
  must document a justification.
* Midterm exam grade will not be counted if it is lower than your final exam
  grade.
* To pass the course you must do the assigned coursework, write the midterm and
  final exams, pass the final exam, and obtain an overall pass average according
  to the grading scheme.
* The instructors reserve the right to modify the grading scheme at any time.
